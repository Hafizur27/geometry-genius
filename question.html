            <p class="text-sm font-normal text-stone-900">A call back function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function so that it can be executed in that other function is called as a callback function. <br>We need callback functions because many JavaScript actions are asynchronous, which means they do not really stop the program from running until they are completed.Thats why we need to use call back function. </p>
